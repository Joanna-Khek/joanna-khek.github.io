    <h3> Diabetes Prediction </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Data Science Competition </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The aim of this competition is to build a model to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. The leaderboard was evaluated on the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve between the predicted and the observed target. I ensembled three models using Catboost and LGBM. My submission was ranked 48/808 in the Private Leaderboard (Top 6%). </p>
