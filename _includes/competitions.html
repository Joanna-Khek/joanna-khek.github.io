   <strong>Shopee Code League - Marketing Analytics (August 2020)</strong> 
   <br />
   Shopee Code League is a 2-month online coding challenge consisting of a series of competitions, online algorithm questions and online training workshops open to all undergraduate students and professionals across the region (Singapore, China, Indonesia,
   Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam). In this Marketing Analytics, the aim is to build a model that can predict whether a user opens the emails sent by Shopee. The dataset contains information about user-specific information, the email nature, user's engagement on the platform and user's reaction to the email. My submission was ranked 54/354 in the Private Leaderboard (Top 16%).

   <strong>Shopee Code League - Product Detection (July 2020)</strong> 
   <br />
   Shopee Code League is a 2-month online coding challenge consisting of a series of competitions, online algorithm questions and online training workshops open to all undergraduate students and professionals across the region (Singapore, China, Indonesia,
   Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam). In this product detection competition, a multiple image classification model needs to be built. There are ~100k images within 42 different categories, including essential medical tools like masks, protective suits and thermometers, home & living products like air-conditioner and fashion products like T-shirts, rings, etc.
   I adopted the fast.ai approach and my submission was ranked 130/646 in the Private Leaderboard (Top 21%).

   <strong>E-Commerce Analytics Hackathon (April 2020)</strong> 
   <br />
   The hackathon was organised by Analytics Vidhya and it ran from 10 April to 12 April.
   The dataset contained a list of products viewed by the user in the given session and also the category, sub-category, sub-sub category and the product id. The aim of this hackathon was to predict the gender of the e-commerce's participants based on their product viewing records.

   <strong>RShiny Compeition 2020 (March 2020)</strong> 
   <br />
   In this competition, I have created a university comparison web application using Rshiny. In this web application, users can view their eligible courses by selecting their A Level grades or GPA. In addition, information such as employment rate and mean income are also available to provide incoming undergrads a sense of direction.
